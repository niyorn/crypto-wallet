# crypto-wallet
Proof of concept for a Crypto wallet. With this wallet you're able to add your crypto coin to the wallet and see how your investment is  worth in the current market. 

To enhance your exprience on this application, we're adding an a way for you to see in a glance how your investment is doing. Your investment font-size will grow or shrink based on the 24 hour changes of the market. Example: If your total coin value increase by 10% than the font-size of your investment will grow by 10% from the base font. So if you're on the the homepage and you see that your investment is displayed really big, than with a glance your just know that your investment is doing good in the current market. - inspired by Sam Gulliker

On top of that, we want to enhance the keyboard experience. Instead of using the standard focus state from the browser, we want to add our own custom focus state that will give the user a clearer feedback where they're focussing on. Also we want to add a transition effect from the current item that you're focussing on to the new item that you've foccused. - inspired by Varsiles
